HOWTO INSTALL

Note that this guide has been tested on Windows and Linux, but none
of our teammates have a Macbook, so it has _not_ been tested on MacOS

First: Install Python
	  - Version 3.8.10 is recommended, but any Python 3 version should work
	  - Ensure that TKinter gets installed with Python.
		    - On Windows, click the custom install option and ensure the
		    'tcl/tk and IDLE' box is checked. 
		    - On Linux, install the python3-tk package.
	  - 3.8.10 can be found at: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/

Second: Run maingui.py with Python
	  - Extract all files to a folder on your computer. We recommend extracting
	  to the desktop.
	  - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder that you just
	  extracted the program into.
	  - Type and run `python3 maingui.py || python maingui.py`
